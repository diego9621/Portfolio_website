# Data Portfolio Website

This website highlights coding projects and skills in data handling, web scraping, ETL pipelines, and clear data presentation. It uses **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, both loaded from CDNs so the site can be deployed as static files without a build step.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Loads React and Tailwind and mounts the application.
- `js/app.jsx` – React components that render the portfolio sections and handle smooth scrolling.

## Customization

Edit `js/app.jsx` to update your information, add projects, or adjust the layout using Tailwind's utility classes.
