# Data Portfolio Website

This website highlights coding projects and skills in data handling, web scraping, ETL pipelines, and clear data presentation. The project now uses **React** and **Tailwind CSS** installed via npm and bundled with **Vite**.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Entry point loaded by Vite.
- `src/App.jsx` – React components that render the portfolio sections and handle smooth scrolling.
- `src/main.jsx` – Boots the React application.

## Customization

Edit `src/App.jsx` to update your information, add projects, or adjust the layout using Tailwind's utility classes.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the test suite:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Use `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
